He’s one of Hollywood’s most entertaining actors. He’s married to Blake Lively, and in 2012, they moved in together.</p><p><strong>Ryan Reynolds currently lives in the Pound Ridge neighborhood in New York City.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ryan-Reynolds-Jaguar-PS-683x1024.jpg><p>The actor managed to keep his house secret for a long time, but he made some videos in what seemed like the living room. So, here’s an insight on Ryan Reynolds’ house, its cost, and more on his rise to fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How did Ryan Reynolds become popular?</strong></h2><p>Ryan Reynolds was born in Vancouver, Canada on October 23, 1976.&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever we see him in movies, we are delighted by his relatable performances and keen sense of comic timing. However, he wasn’t always like that as a child.</p><p>Before he turned 12, Ryan Reynolds <a href=# rel=noopener>was a timid child</a> and seemed to be sensitive to everything. He was a calm child who didn’t feel like he fit in anywhere except in his school’s productions.</p><p>So, he started joining school plays since his natural vulnerability wouldn’t be so obvious on stage. When he was 12 years old, he landed a role on Hillside, a Canadian teen series that is known as Fifteen in the United States. It aired from 1991 to 1993.</p><p>But, Ryan Reynolds’ career seemed to go down a notch after the show. He managed to star in smaller roles, including a guest appearance in The X Files. He didn’t get much luck and had to take on multiple odd jobs after high school. He moved to Los Angeles in the late 1990’s where he took on menial tasks to pay his bills.</p><p>Ryan’s major breakthrough in television in Hollywood came after he was cast as a medical student in Two Guys, A Girl, and A Pizza Place in 1998. The series ran until 2001 and was later changed to Two Guys and A Girl.</p><p>After his role in the show, he delved into movies and started getting attention from producers.</p><p>He starred as a vampire hunter in the 2004 movie Blade: The Trinity with Jessica Biel and Wesley Snipes. Although he didn’t have many fans at first, he still garnered attention from fans.</p><p>People Magazine named him Sexiest Man Alive in 2010. That time marks Ryan Reynolds having “arrived” in Hollywood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How rich is Ryan Reynolds?</strong></h2><p>Ryan Reynolds was worth around $150 million in 2021. He was initially paid $2 million when he starred in Deadpool but his salary increased after the movie.</p><p>Ryan became one of the highest paid actors, earning over $20 million per movie role. Additionally, he had some bonuses and backend pay in the Deadpool franchise and made over $20 million after the movie debuted.&nbsp;</p><p>When he starred in 6 Underground, he was paid $27 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from acting, Ryan Reynolds also invested in shares. The actor seems to understand the advantage of buying assets.</p><p>He has a minority stake in Aviation American Gin and even did an ad campaign for the brand. The campaign raked in millions of dollars and the gin company became America’s second-largest super-premium gin brand. He wears the creative director hat for the brand.</p><p>In 2019, Ryan Reynolds became the ambassador of Armani Code. He also headed the ad campaign for their Absolu Scent. Then he bought a minority stake in Mint Mobile, a prepaid mobile phone service.</p><p>Ryan Reynolds makes most of his money from his acting career and investment portfolio. He also released a movie in 2022, The Adam Project with Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner. The movie made $599 million domestically and worldwide barely 6 months after its release.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How much is Ryan Reynolds’ house?</strong></h2><p>In 2012, Ryan Reynolds started dating a colleague, actress Blake Lively. Both of them starred together in Green Lantern before their relationship kicked off. They moved in together to a house in the Pound Ridge Neighborhood in New York City.</p><p>The property is 11.65 acres and their home is 9,000 square feet. It has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms. The living room walls are lined with wooden panels, and decorated with tall lamps and sunset pictures.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The house is grand but homey, and almost looks like a home out of a novel–perfect for raising their children James, Inez, and Betty.</p><p>It is painted grey outside and has a British-like payphone outside. There are also two marble cupboards in the kitchen with gold detailing. They also have a large closet that has multiple shelves and wardrobes.&nbsp;</p><p>The New York house costs $6 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGwsdJmqbKZnmK%2FpsXNqKOdq12htrexjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./appear-to-be-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Appear to be</a>
