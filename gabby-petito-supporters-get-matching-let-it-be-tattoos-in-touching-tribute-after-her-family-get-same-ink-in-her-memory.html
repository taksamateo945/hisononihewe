hashtags: <a href=#>#RipGabby</a>, <a href=#>#didnotknowherbutwillalwaysremberher</a>, <a href=#>#JusticeForGabby</a> and then ended with a question:&nbsp;</p><p>“Why couldn’t [Brian] just let her be..”</p><h2><strong>‘ALL THE TIME’</strong></h2><p>In September, both of Gabby’s parents, Nicole Schmidt and Joe Petito showed off their right forearms fit with <a href=#>“Let it be”</a> tattoos and ocean crest.</p><p>They also received a “believe” tattoo in script brimming over with flowers.</p><p>For them, it was a way to keep the 22-year-old Long Island native with them “all the time.”</p><h2><strong>MIXED REACTION</strong></h2><p>The showing of solidarity with Gabby by duplicating the same ink riffing off the Beatles hit song, Let it Be, was convincing others to the same while rankling some.&nbsp;</p><p>“I love this,” reads one response. “I’ve thought about getting it done too.”</p><p><strong>Read our <a href=#>Gabby Petito live blog</a> for the very latest news and updates…</strong></p><p>Some are Beatles fans but see no harm in getting inked to pay respects to Gabby.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s actually a really beautiful tattoo,” one person offered.&nbsp;</p><p>“I thought about getting it… It would remind me of Gabby, but that’s not why I would get it.&nbsp;</p><p>“Whatever someone’s reasoning is, it’s their own.”</p><p>But the majority of 750 comments met the idea with discord.&nbsp;</p><p>“Only family or her close friends should be getting tattoos in memory of her,” one commenter wrote. “Especially her own personal tattoo… I get it’s a song but when you say your getting it for gabby is just odd.”</p><h2>‘WRONG AND DISRESPECTFUL’</h2><p>Some scolded the effort as an insult to Gabby’s grieving family.&nbsp;</p><p>“Bro, if I were Gabby’s mother and I found out complete strangers were replicating her tattoo to “remember” her, I would be PISSED! Like hunting your asses down to teach you a lesson about respect.”</p><p>“Seriously stop,” wrote the commenter. “How do you think her mother & parents would feel, as THATS THEIR WAY OF BEING CONNECTED to her.”</p><p>The person said the effort was offensive.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s the last thing they have of her & you wanna go & ruin it by “adding yourself to their circle” ABSOLUTELY WRONG & DISRESPECTFUL!!”</p><p>A person who admitted getting the tattoo 10 years ago did so “because I was bullied really bad in school” and struggled with addiction.</p><p>The person didn’t agree with getting such a tattoo to pay respects to the late young woman.</p><p>“But I would never get “ let it be” in memory of gabby… unless I knew her personally,” the person confessed.</p><h2><strong>MISSING TO MURDERED</strong></h2><p>Gabby was last seen on August 24, 2021, checking out of a hotel with Brian in Salt Lake City, <a href=#>Utah</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href=#>Gabby</a> was first reported missing, photos of her tattoos were being shared as a way to confirm her identity.</p><p>Since Gabby’s remains were found on September 19<strong> </strong>in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming her distinct tattoos were used to verify the body as Gabby’s.</p><h2>‘BELIEVE’</h2><p>The “believe” and “Let It Be” tattoos serve as a somber reminder of Gabby’s faith, and the firm belief her parents professed in the early days of the search, that <a href=#>their daughter would come home</a>.</p><p>The wave and flower tattoos signify Gabby’s appreciation of natural abundance.</p><p>Her love of nature was a central tenet of the young vlogger’s personality, and a pivotal force behind her <a href=#>decision to live the “van life”</a> that had her trekking across the country to several national parks.</p><p>Gabby’s father Joe also sported a lefthand tattoo mimicking a set of two vines that wrapped around both her and Brian’s fingers</p><p>According to <a href=#>TattooSEO</a>, vine tattoos represent loyalty and a desire to stick by someone’s side.</p><p>Last year, Brian posted a photo of himself and Gabby, which included the caption “<a href=#>Till death do us part</a> or until I wake up, I’m so happy the answer was yes.”</p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>Gabby Petito timeline</h3><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000679560590-6.jpg><p class=article__content--intro>Gabby Petito, 22, was last seen on August 24, leaving a hotel in Utah.
