He formed the tag team “Texas Mustangs” with Bobby Duncum, Jr.; they quickly won the GWF Tag Team Championship from Rough Riders (Black Bart and Johnny Mantell) on November 27 but dropped the titles to The Bad Breed (Ian and Axl Rotten) on January 29, 1993.

Layfield won the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship on January 14, 1995, defeating Kevin Von Erich. Two months later, he lost the NWA North American title to Greg “The Hammer” Valentine.</p><p>After three and a half years touring the independent circuit, Layfield signed a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1995 and debuted on January 27, 1996 episode of WWF Superstars as Justin “Hawk” Bradshaw, defeating Bob Holly in his debut match. His initial gimmick was that of a tough cowboy/mountain man (similar in terms of appearance and character to Stan Hansen), with Uncle Zebakiah as his manager. After victories, he branded his opponents with the symbol “JB” in ink, rather than being seared into the flesh. Bradshaw remained undefeated for three months until a loss to The Undertaker via disqualification on the April 1 episode of Raw. He lost a Caribbean Strap Match to Savio Vega on the September 22, 1996 PPV In Your House 10: Mind Games. The character fizzled out by the end of the year, perhaps remembered only for a feud with Savio Vega and a match with Fatu which he won in eight seconds.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>John Layfield height</b> <strong>6 ft 6 in</strong> John <strong>weight</strong> <strong>135 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>135 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In January 1993, Layfield went on his first overseas trip to Japan, wrestling for George and Shunji Takano’s Network Of Wrestling. Later that same year, he would also wrestle in Mexico for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre, wrestling under the name Vampiro Americano and frequently teamed with Vampiro Canadiense. He would also wrestle for Federacion Internacional de Lucha Libre, where he won its Heavyweight Championship. In June 1994, he went to Europe and toured Austria and Germany for Otto Wanz’s Catch Wrestling Association (CWA), where he won its World Tag Team Championship with Cannonball Grizzly in November 1995. In March 1995, he returned to Japan, but with NOW recently folded, he went to Genichiro Tenryu’s WAR, where he went by the name Death Mask. Before joining the World Wrestling Federation, he was set to join Smoky Mountain Wrestling in December 1995, to wrestle Buddy Landel, but didn’t happen due to the company closing in November.</p><p align=justify>In February 1997, Layfield paired up with his storyline cousin Barry Windham to form The New Blackjacks, complete with the traditional “Blackjack” handlebar mustaches and short, jet black hair. In late 1997 Bradshaw traveled to the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) where he competed as a singles wrestler (without Windham). During his time in the USWA he helped his former manager in the WWF, Dutch Mantel (known in the WWF as Uncle Zebekiah) defeat Jerry Lawler for the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship.</p><h2>Who is John Layfield Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>John Layfield</strong> married to <strong>Meredith Whitney , Cindy Womack </strong>.

He earned a shot at the NWA North American Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Jarrett at No Way Out of Texas: In Your House and won by disqualification, but Jarrett retained the title because a title cannot change hands by a disqualification. In 1998, he wrestled as a mid-carder wrestling the likes of Marc Mero at Mayhem in Manchester, Kaientai (Funaki, Dick Togo, and Men’s Teioh) with Taka Michinoku in a handicap match at Over the Edge in which Michinoku was pinned, and Vader in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Breakdown which was won by Bradshaw.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>John Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Wrestler</strong>.

John Layfield celebrates birthday on November 29 of every year.</p><p align=justify>On Sunday Night Heat right before Survivor Series 1998, Bradshaw teamed alongside former Nation of Domination leader Faarooq to form the tag team of the Acolytes, managed by the Jackyl. Their main gimmick was that of a dark duo known for their unrepentant savagery against their opponents, occult symbols painted on their chest and the Necronomicon “gate of Yog-Sothoth” pentagram symbol on their black tights. After the Jackyl left the WWF, Faarooq and Bradshaw joined The Undertaker’s new Ministry of Darkness. The Ministry went on to feud with the Corporation. As part of the Ministry, Bradshaw feuded with Ken Shamrock. The two stables would soon unite as the Corporate Ministry, but disbanded after Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated the Undertaker at Fully Loaded. When the Undertaker went on hiatus in September, Bradshaw and Faarooq’s dark gimmick faded.</p><h3>Is JBL a Millionaire?</h3><p>JBL, <b>a self-made millionaire</b> and founder of the popular and best-selling Mamajuana Extreme and 418 energy drinks, is proud of his wife’s success, but isn’t surprised by what she’s been able to achieve while being married to him.</p><h3>Why did JBL quit WWE?</h3><p>On September 1, 2017, JBL announced that he was stepping away from the SmackDown Live commentary team <b>to focus on humanitarian work in and out of WWE</b>, mainly as a Beyond Sport Global Ambassador.</p><h3>Did JBL play in the NFL?</h3><p>JBL <b>signed with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1990</b>.</p><h3>How old is JBL?</h3><table readability=4><tr>NameJohn Charles Layfield</tr><tr readability=3><td>DOB</td><td>29 November 1966, <b>55 years</b></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>198 cm</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>132 kg</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Occupation</td><td>Professional wrestler, Commentator, Businessman, Football Player</td></tr></table><h3>How rich is Rey Mysterio?</h3><table><tr>Net Worth:<b>$10 Million</b></tr><tr><td>Profession:</td><td>Wrestler, Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality:</td><td>United States of America</td></tr></table>You may read full biography about John Layfield from Wikipedia.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKGzornOrqqboaKptaWt2GeaqKVfn7ypuoylmLKemZq5pXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./castlevania-nocturne-juste-belmont-voice-actor.html>&#171;&nbsp;Juste Belmont Voice Actor in Castlevania Nocturne: Meet Iain Glen!</a>
