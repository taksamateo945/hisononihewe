Unofficially though, the drug dealer who is currently serving a 30-year prison time for his drug-related activities could have fathered more children besides Lil Meech.</strong></p><p>More than a couple of women, including Instagram and Twitter users @queentrudy and Demetria Edwardior Jackson have stepped up in recent times to claim that Big Meech was their dad. The Starz TV series, Big Mafia Family (BMF), also indicates that Big Meech may have had a daughter named Neeka, and there are also musings about him being the biological father of Lori Harvey after suggestions that he might have had a relationship with Lori’s mother, Marjorie Harvey, who is the current wife of TV personality Steve Harvey. This article answers all the questions one might have about Big Meech’s progeny.</p><h2><strong>Demetrius “Lil Meech” Flenory Jr. Is Big Meech’s Recognized Child</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> April 22, 2000</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 23 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Actor, Rapper</li></ul><p>Demetrius Flenory Jr. aka Lil Meech was born in Miami, Florida, United States, on April 22, 2000. He is currently 23 years old and his birth sign is Taurus. As was stated previously, Demetrius Flenory Jr. is officially recognized as the only son of Big Meech. His birth is a by-product of a relationship the drug kingpin had with real estate agent Latarra Eutsey.</p><p>Not much is known about how his parents’ relationship started but our best guess would be that they started dating in the late 1990s and remained a couple until Big Meech was imprisoned for his illegal business dealings.</p><p>Details of Lil Meech’s early life are unclear at present but several reports have confirmed that he was only five years old when the law caught up with and served justice to his father, Big Meech, for being a drug dealer and a money launderer.</p><p>His involvement in the establishment of the drug enterprise known as the Big Mafia Family, which was actively involved in drug dealing and money laundering operations throughout the United States was what led to his downfall.</p><p>Thereafter, Lil Meech sort of disappeared from the spotlight, not that he had seen much of it since he was born up to that point. Essentially, details of the early existence of Big Meeh’s first, and possibly only child, have yet to become public knowledge.</p><h3><strong>Big Meech’s Son Is In The Show Business</strong></h3><p>It took a while for him to get up to it, but Lil Meech appears to have found his way into show business as a rapper and an actor. He announced his presence on the scene with the release of his debut song title Bad Habits&nbsp;in 2019. The music video showed a 30-second clip of his father conversing from the slammer.</p><p>That was only his first footprint in the entertainment business, and not even he was prepared for what was to come next. Lil Meech’s first acting experience came in the Starz TV series Black Mafia Family (BMF) where he portrayed the role of the main character Demetrius Edward Flenory aka Big Meech.</p><p>Lil Meech once detailed how he got the part. His dad had called from jail to tell him that rapper, actor, and film producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson had purchased the rights to make the Black Mafia Family story into a Movie or TV series. The series would essentially tell the story of Big Meech and his brother Southwest T, their drug-dealing and money-laundering enterprise, and how they met their end at the hands of the FBI.</p><p>Lil Meech was then convinced by his father to get in touch with 50 Cent so that he could get a feel of what the production of the adaptation was like. Somewhere down the line, Flenory Jr. also bought the idea from Curtis that he should enroll in acting classes that would enable him to portray the role of his father in the series.</p><p>While the idea seemed too far-fetched at the beginning, mainly because Flenory Jr. was enrolled at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas studying business, it all worked out in the end because Lil Meech was a natural whose performances earned him some positive critical reviews.</p><p>The actor who believes he has found his calling, and now wants to act for the rest of his life, has added to his acting credits with his appearance as Travis, a DJ, and producer, in season 2 of HBO’s Euphoria.</p><p>Prior to his involvement in Euphoria, Lil Meech, a big fan of the show, showered several accolades on the production team as he claimed the series addressed several societal issues and was good for the culture.</p><p>He also starred as Syl in the American drama film Taurus. The film which was released in 2022 was the actor’s first feature-length film but his words and attitude tell us it won’t be his last. One thing that can be said for Flenory Jr. though, is that he found a way not to follow in his father’s footsteps as a drug dealer, and all signs point to the fact that the trajectory of his life would be very different from his father’s.</p><h2><strong>Big Meech May Have Fathered Other Children</strong></h2><p>It’s no secret that Big Meech had his way with women, and there is every chance that more than one of the numerous women he dealt with romantically had a baby or two for him. The probability that he had more than one child was hinted in the Starz series BMF.</p><p>In the series, viewers are introduced to Neeka. Neeka’s mother, according to the series, is a woman named Lori Walker, a character portrayed by actress Serayah. Walker, according to some unverified sources, had a long romantic relationship with the drug kingpin and the result of that relationship was a daughter named Neeka.</p><p>Furthermore, over the past few years, several women have come forward to claim that Big Meech was their biological father. Among them are Instagram and Twitter users @queentrudy and Demetria Edwardior Jackson. However, neither of these claims has been verified, and in truth, it would take at least half a decade, or even more to do so seeing that Big Meech isn’t set to be released from prison until 2028.</p><p>The most bizarre suggestion about who might be one of Big Meech’s children is that socialite Lori Harvey, daughter of Marjorie Harvey, who herself is the wife of TV personality Steve Harvey, might be Big Meech’s daughter. Again the basis for this speculation is the assumption that Big Meech and Marjorie were romantically involved several years ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLWww4ymmKexXaC2pb%2BMnaaeq12Xtqh5zJ6cnKBdna63sYyapZ1lp528bq3RnmStoJWufA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ricky-ireland.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ricky Ireland: YouTuber, Age, Height, Real Name, Net Worth!</a>
